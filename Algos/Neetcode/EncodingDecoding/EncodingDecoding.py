# Encoding
# If the input list is empty, return an empty string.
#
# Create an empty list to store the sizes of each string.
#
# For each string, append its length to the sizes list.
# 
# Build a single string by:
#   Writing all sizes separated by commas.
#   Adding a '#' to mark the end of the size section.
#   Appending all the actual strings in order.
#   Return the final encoded string.
    
#   Decoding
#    If the encoded string is empty, return an empty list.
#    Read characters from the start until reaching '#' to extract all recorded sizes:
#    Parse each size by reading until a comma.
#    After the '#', extract substrings according to the sizes list:
#    For each size, read that many characters and append the substring to the result.
#    Return the list of decoded strings.


# 1. Take sentence and concat into one final string using length of string and # delimiter
